# vlmd-submission-tools

Python CLI with subcommands to support argo workflows for VLMD submission.

## Installation

1. Install poetry if you don't already have it (https://python-poetry.org/)
2. Install package `poetry install` (Note: poetry can manage environments but you can also generate a virtual environment yourself; regardless always build in a venv).

## Running locally

To see the available subcommands:

```
vlmd-submission-tools
```

To access the help documentation for a particular subcommand:

```
vlmd-submission-tools <subcommand> -h
```

The Gen3 commons hostname (eg, `qa-heal.planx-pla.net`) should be set as the environment variable `GEN3_HOSTNAME`.

The fence client-credentials are read from JSON in a kubernetes secret.
You could run Rancher Desktop locally for storing and retrieving the kubernetes secret.
The local storage should mimic the structure of a secret stored by `g3auto`.
In particular, if the secret is generated from a file, the main key for the secret would match the file name.

For example, if your fence credentials are in the JSON file `credentials.json`,
use the following to create a secret that matches the `g3auto` structure:

```
kubectl create secret generic CLIENT_SECRET_NAME --from-file=credentials.json=credentials.json
```

### Submission workflow

The following subcommands are executed for the VLMD dictionary submission and validation:

```
vlmd-submission-tools GetDictionaryUrl -d <indexd guid> -o <local json output>
vlmd-submission-tools ReadAndValidateDictionary -f <dictionary file name> -l <local file path> -u <dictionary url> -o <local json output>
vlmd-submission-tools UploadDictionaryToMds -j <path to json dictionary> -n <dictionary name> -s <mds studyid> -o <local json output>
```

Each task requires a `-o` parameter to specify the local JSON output artifact, eg

`-o /tmp/url_parameters.json`

### Fence client credentials

Some of the subcommands utilize fence client-credentials.

The credentials can be generated with the `fence-create` command. These can then be written to a json file and deployed
as a kubernetes secret.

For a production environment your credentials secret can be
deployed via `g3auto` or rotatated periodically via a `cloud-automation` job. The secrets generated by `g3auto`
have a main key that is derived from the name of the file
that stores the secrets, eg. `credentials.json`.

The name and keys for the kubernetes secret are specified in `common/config.py`.

```
{
    config.CLIENT_SECRET_KEY_CONFIG:
    {
        config.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG: <client_id>,
        config.CLIENT_SECRET_CONFIG: <client_secret>
    }
}
``````

The fence client will need some permissions set in the user.yaml file.
For example, use the following if your fence client name is `vlmd_client` and the `authz` of the indexd upload is `/programs/DEV`:

```
  vlmd_client:
    policies:
    - mds_admin
    - indexd_admin
    - audit_reader
    - requestor_admin
    - programs.DEV-admin
```

## Adding a new subcommand

1. Create a python file in `vlmd_submission_tools/subcommands/`
2. Inherit from the `vlmd_submission_tools.subcommands.Subcommand` abstract base class.
3. Follow the subcommand API to implement your subcommand:

```python
 class MySubcommand(Subcommand): # This class name will be the subcommand to call on the command line
     @classmethod
     def __add_arguments__(cls, parser: ArgumentParser) -> None: # Define your subcommand-specific arguments
         """Add the subcommand params"""
         parser.add_argument(
             "inputs",
             help="Input to process.",
         )

     @classmethod
     def main(cls, options: Namespace) -> None: # All the main logic of your subcommand goes here
         """
         Entrypoint for MySubcommand
         """
         logger = Logger.get_logger(cls.__tool_name__()) # create a logger by importing this class: from vlmd_submission_tools.common.logger import Logger
         logger.info(cls.__get_description__())

         # do stuff...

     @classmethod
     def __get_description__(cls) -> str: # Define the subcommand description which will appear in CLI
         """
         Description of tool.
         """
         return (
             "This subcommand does really cool stuff. "
             "It outputs some things and handles some inputs."
         )
```
4. Import your subcommand class in `vlmd_submission_tools/subcommands/__init__.py`
5. Import your subcommand in `vlmd_submission_tools/__main__.py`
6. Add your subcommand class to the `vlmd_submission_tools.__main__.main` function where the other ones are called: `MySubcommand.add(subparsers=subparsers)`
7. Create unit tests.

If you need to add dependencies you must use the `poetry add ...` functionality.
